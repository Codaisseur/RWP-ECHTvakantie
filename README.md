# ECHTvakantie

## Summary

This project was part of the Real World Project assignment at Codaisseur Academy. We were assigned a client and had a week to create a website(Ruby on Rails) for him. As our co-operation was good, we decided to continue improving this project, thus it is still work in progress.

The purpose of the website is to display vacations that our client has experience with and categorize them by themes. Upon clikcing on a theme, several vacations are displayed (filtering and searching for specific vacancies also possible). Once on a selected vacation page you can see a description, pictures, location (googlemaps API), review by our client and suggestions for other vacations related to the theme.

We also implemented a CMS for our client, so it would be easy for him to add/adjust the content of the website.
